                                                <h3 className="title">Volatility and the Investor</h3>
                                                <p>Investors are alarmed by volatility and the economic downturn. The stock market is known
                                                    for its unpredictable nature. For example, the Sensex dropped nearly 1,000 points in a single
                                                    day during the most recent financial year. Mutual fund participants frequently think about
                                                    stopping their SIP investments during such circumstances. This is not wise nor advisable.
                                                    Investors must keep up SIPs and make plans for long-term gains.</p>
                                                <p>Investors are presented with this issue each time there is a market correction (of
                                                    discontinuing of sip and maybe redeeming investments). They discontinue their SIPs and
                                                    either invest the funds in fixed income (debt funds) or stop them entirely.</p>
                                                <p>So, in such a market environment, what is the best option? Here are some pointers:</p>
                                                <ul className="list-style">
                                                    <li>Market declines that cause SIPs to underperform are not an excuse to quit investing.</li>
                                                    <li>After a market decline, investors must increase their SIPs. Increase SIP investments if
                                                        at all possible.</li>
                                                    <li>SIP investments should be made over the recommended time period of 5 to 10
                                                        years, during which the equity markets may experience ups and downs, but investors
                                                        would stand to gain.</li>
                                                </ul>
                                                <p className="mt-5">Usually, it is too soon to evaluate a SIP investment after one or two years. The minimal time
                                                    frame for evaluating the performance of an equity fund is five to seven years.</p>
